# Notebooks

The [Notebooks](https://notebooks.egi.eu) service provides an interactive
computing platform  to create documents that can combine text, mathematics,
computations and their rich media output using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)
and [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub) technologies and can
scale to multiple servers and users with the
[Cloud Compute](https://www.egi.eu/services/cloud-compute/) service.

This repository contains the basic documentation on the EGI Notebooks service
and serves as main entry point for collecting issues and requirements.
