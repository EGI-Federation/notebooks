AGINFRA+/D4Science
::::::::::::::::::

An instance of the EGI notebooks is deployed for the `AGINFRA+ <http://plus.aginfra.eu/>`_
project and made available via selected `D4Science VREs <https://www.d4science.org/>`_.
Besides the features described above, this instance has been further
customised to support:

* Embedding the EGI notebooks interface into the community we portal, no
  separate web browser windows or tab to access the notebooks functionality.

* Integration of AAI between Notebooks and the community portal for single-sign
  on. Enabled users are automatically recognised by the notebooks.

* Access to other VRE services from the notebooks using their personal token
  easily available in the notebooks environment.

* File sharing between notebooks and the community web portal file space.
