Welcome to EGI Notebooks's documentation!
=========================================

The more you go in data analysis, the more you understand that the most
suitable tool for coding and visualizing is not a pure code, or SQL IDE, or
even simplified data manipulation diagrams (aka workflows or jobs). From some
point you realize that you need a mix of these all – that’s what “notebook”
platforms are, with Jupyter being the most popular notebook software out there.

Notebooks is an 'as a Service' environment based on the `Jupyter technology
<http://jupyter.org/>`_ , offering a browser-based, scalable tool for
interactive data analysis. The Notebooks environment provides users with
notebooks where they can combine text, mathematics, computations and rich media
output. EGI Notebooks is a multi-user service and can scale to multiple servers
based on the `EGI Cloud service <https://www.egi.eu/services/cloud-compute/>`_.
