Integration with other services
-------------------------------

Notebooks running on EGI can access other existing computing and storage
services. The centrally operated EGI Notebooks instance is using resources
from the access.egi.eu Virtual Organisation. We are open to suggestions on
which services you would like to access to create guidelines and extend the
service with tools to ease these tasks.
